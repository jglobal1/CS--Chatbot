### **2. Smart Context Detection**
The system now intelligently detects question types and provides appropriate context:

#### **For Specific Course Questions:**
```python
# Detects: "Who teaches COS101?", "What is COS102 about?"
# Provides: Course-specific PDF content with exact lecturer names
```

#### **For Lecturer Questions:**
```python
# Detects: "Who are the lecturers?", "Who teaches Computer Science?"
# Provides: Complete lecturer list with courses they teach
```

#### **For Career Questions:**
```python
# Detects: "What career paths are available?", "What industries can I work in?"
# Provides: Comprehensive career and industry information
```

#### **For Skills Questions:**
```python
# Detects: "What skills are essential?", "What should I learn?"
# Provides: Essential skills list for Computer Science students
```

### **3. Enhanced Routing Logic**

### **6. API Endpoints**

#### **Main Endpoint (Smart Routing):**
```
POST /ask
```
- Automatically detects question type
- Uses appropriate model (Groq with PDF data for CS questions)
- Falls back to external APIs for general questions

#### **Direct Groq PDF Endpoint:**
```
POST /ask-groq-pdf
```
- Directly uses Groq with PDF data
- Enhanced context detection
- Specific course and lecturer information

### **7. Testing**

#### **Test Script:**
```bash
python test_groq_pdf.py
```

#### **Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ CS questions use Groq with PDF data
- ‚úÖ Lecturer questions return specific names
- ‚úÖ Career questions use PDF career information
- ‚úÖ General questions use external APIs
- ‚úÖ No more generic responses for specific questions

### **8. Key Benefits**
